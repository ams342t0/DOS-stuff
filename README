 I. AUTHENTICITY

       Virus Check+ performs a self-test everytime it is executed.
 If the test fails, then the file has been modified in any way. A 
 warning will be displayed and then it will try to restore itself
 to its original clean state if possible and still continue  to 
 check for viruses after confirmation from the user has been made.
 It will also checks for the presence of a companion file that has
 the same name but an extension of .COM. If it finds one, then the
 file is automatically deleted.


 II. FILE LIST

 This Version of Virus Check+ Package contains the following files:

                 NAME        SIZE (Bytes)      Date

                 VCHECK.EXE  41,545            01/20/99
                 VCHECK.DOC  13660             01/20/99

       If your copy of VCHECK.EXE differs from that of  what is
 listed above then it may have been modified. Discontinue using
 by removing it from your system then obtain a clean copy.


 III. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

     - IBM PC/AT , 80286 or higher processor 
     - 256k of RAM
     - DOS 3.3 or higher
     - 70kb of disk space

 IV. FEATURES

 i. What's New

      - This version of Virus Check+ detects 250 most common ,old & new and
        "in the wild" Viruses and cleans 235 of them. Some of the viruses
        simply damage and overwrite the files they infect. So this makes
        it impossible to restore or remove the virus.

        ( See the Virus List on section 2)

      - Fast memory scanning and virus deactivations

      - MBR Disinfection

        To view the virus list type VCheck /List at the command prompt. 


 V. OVERVIEW

        Virus Check+ is a virus detection and identification tool used for
 the IBM PC and compatible computers. It will search a PC for known computer
 viruses in memory, boot sector, partition table and the files.

        Virus Check+ will search the system using standard search strings or
 patterns that are unique to each computer virus, and then  reporting their
 presence if found. This method  works only for viruses that are known to
 Virus Check+ and also viruses that are DOS based.

        Virus Check+ scans diskette or entire systems for nearly all computer
 virus infections. It will identify the virus infecting the system, and tell
 what area of the system (memory, boot sector, file, partition table )  the
 virus was found. Other variants of the most common viruses like Jerusalem,
 Stoned, Vienna are 50% inaccurately but still can  be  identified by Virus
 Check+ as viruses belonging to the same family.


 VI. OPERATION


 i. How to use Virus Check+

       Virus Check+ will check each area or file on the designated
 drive that could be infected with a virus.  If a virus is found, 
 a window is displayed telling the name of the infected object
 with name of the identified virus and the area in which it was found.
       When Virus Check+ is executed without any parameters, it
 defaults to proceed  Memory Scan -> Self-Check -> Scan files in the
 current directory of the current drive.  Virus Check+ treats  all
 executable files with the following extensions .EXE, .COM, .SYS,
 .BIN, .OV?, .DRV and it will scan these files by default.


 ii. Command Line Parameters

 VII.  Virus Removal

      i. FILE

           File-based viruses are the hardest ones to disinfect. Because
      most of these viruses may employ polymorphism in the code and thus
      making their presence harder to detect. The most common way to
      remove File-based viruses is to restore from backup.

    ii.  MBR

           Most viruses of these type are the easiest to clean. As the
      famous FDISK /MBR will suffice. But latter may fail sometimes as
      some viruses like the Monkey virus overwrites the partition table
      with its own code, thus making the disk invisible if you try to
      boot from a floppy disk, because DOS doesn't recognize the drive.

    iii. BOOT

           These type of viruses are the easiest to  clean by simply 
     SYSing the disk. For floppy disks this will always be sufficient
     to owerwrite the virus. But in most cases the virus will also
     infect the partition table in hard disks. This group of viruses
     are the common viruses around. Some of these viruses
     will also infect files (Multipartite) thus making them a bit
     harder to discover by the user, though.

    iv.  MEMORY

           Most of those type of viruses mentioned are memory resident.
     Which means they stay in the system memory while infecting the system
     in the background, affecting run-time operations etc. Viruses of this
     type must be removed from memory in order to properly disinfect the
     system, such as booting from a virus free floppy disk, then proceeding
     with virus scanning. However, in the case of VCheck+ which can safely
     remove/disable the virus in memory, so it is okey to continue scanning
     without the risk that any viral activity might occur.


 VIII. DISCLAIMER

      Virus Check+ is freeware, therefore it disclaims all warranties and
 guarranties. Virus Check+ only scans and cleans viruses that are known
 to it so it is not responsible for program corruptions due to other viruses
 lurking in your system :(. If you suspect you have a virus that is unknown
 to Virus Check+ then you must scan your system using other advanced foreign
 anti-virus products such as F-Prot, AVP and TBAV.
      Take it from me, they are among the best. And better yet send a copy
 of the virus to the address below. I would gladly appreciate it. Then in
 return, I will send you an update copy of VCheck with the disinfection of
 the virus you sent.

 IX. KNOWN BUGS
 
     - VCheck will not able to restore itself after infection from a full
       stealth or tunneling virus, though. Also, it is impossible for VCheck
       to restore itself if the disk is other than write enabled. Hence, it
       is not Hacker proof nor Virus proof.

     - Behaves differently if ran under a Win95 DOS windows. To resolve,
       always run full screen.

     - "Illegal Operation" message if run under Win98. This has to do with
       the 32Bit disk access. I also experienced this on WinNT4, with the
       message "Not using 32bit disk access", but still resumes after
       ignoring the message.


 X. FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

       Future enhancements include:

    -  WordMacro, Excel Virus detection and removal.
    -  Win 3.xx and Win9x virus detection and removal.
    -  Windows 95/98 interfacing.
